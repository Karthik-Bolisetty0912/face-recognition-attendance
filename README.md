# face-recognition-attendance
This project is a real-time face recognitionâ€“based attendance system developed using an ESP32-CAM module and Python. It automates the process of recording attendance by capturing live images via the ESP32-CAM and identifying registered individuals using facial recognition techniques. It prevents proxy attendance in classrooms or offices.
